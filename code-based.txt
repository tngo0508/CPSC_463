data flow testing part 1
define = the time when you input value for the variable
ex: input(price) (node 5)
define is different from declare in node 2(var totalPrice, price)

Node 6 shows a "use" of the variable price
pay attention at Define of a variable and use of a variable
purpose: keep track of variable to travel all DU pair so order to make sure
nothing is wrong. Help to design test cases that variable is defined and used as
expected
A DU pair reveals the beginning and ending of the data flow associated with a
given table

data flow testing part 3
slice-based testing: cut the program into smaller pieces but each piece has to
be executable
pay attention to interesting data, ignore the irrelevant data (data portion)
pay attention to control flow
CONTROL DEPENDENCE GRAPH
component of program = instruction of program
component that is not nested within a loop or conditional
don't want to take out the nodes that effect control of program
